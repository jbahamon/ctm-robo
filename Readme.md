Robo is a three-button character (a+b+c keys) made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's missing:

- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)


## Moveset

Robo is a slow character. He hits hard but can't combo very well. 
His supers have a medium range, but it can be hard to combo into them if your 
opponent runs away.

Robo's second jump activates his Robo Burner. It relies on fuel, displayed below
him. You can hold down Up, Left or Right while jumping and Robo will fly in 
that direction. You can also fly diagonally up. Fuel replenishes while grounded.

In addition, Robo's Air Medium Punch and Air Hard Punch use up some fuel (10% 
and 15%, respectively) to execute to its fullest. Robo's air attacks are faster 
and more comboable.

Finally, his ground Hard Punch has some super armor frames.

### Special Moves

- **Robo Launcher**: `D, DB, B + a/b/c` (Air)

Requires 500 Power and 50% Fuel. Robo uses his thrusters to quickly fly towards 
his opponent. He grabs his opponent, flies them into the air, turns them upside 
down, then crashes them into the ground.

- **Robo Tackle**: `F, D, DF + a/b/c` (Ground)

Robo does a diagonal tackle into the air. The button used determines the
attack's trajectory and damage.

- **Area Bomb**: `D, DB, B + a/b/c` (Ground)

Robo creates a small explosion around him.

- **Rocket Punch**: `D, DF, F + a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

Requires 30% Fuel if performed in the air. Robo sends his fist flying towards 
the opponent. The button used determines the fist's speed. 

### Super Moves

- **Shock**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Similar to Area Bomb. Robo opens up and electrocutes 
anyone who comes too close.

- **Uzzi Punch**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground). Requires 1000 Power.

Requires 1000 Power. Robo throws a multi-punch in front of him. The attack 
ends with a small explosion. This super move can be comboed from other moves.

- **Omega Laser**: `D, B, D, F + a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Robo shoots a short-range laser towards the enemy.

### Special Mode

- **Electrocute**: `a+c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Robo overloads and electric arcs appear around him. His thrusters are 
forcefully activated, so only air attacks can be performed while in this state. 
Fuel reserves are unlimited until his Power depletes completely.

### Final Move

- **Prometheus Cannon**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (while Electrocute is active)

Spends all remaining Power. Robo pulls a big cannon out of nowhere, and shoots a huge beam 
of energy.


## 12p Mode

Robo's 12p mode is based on MvC's Ironman. He uses 4 buttons instead of 3. `a`, `b` and `c` 
are Light, Mid and Heavy Attack, respectively, and `x` is the Launcher Attack, which can 
be used to start an air combo.

In his 12p Mode you also get access to an Air Dash (pressing twice in the same direction 
while in the air), a Super Jump (`D, U`). His Air Heavy Attack can be aimed up or down. 
Damage scaling is implemented: this is, as a combo goes on for longer, additional attacks 
will inflict less and less damage.

### 12p Special Moves

- **Flight**: `D, DB, B, x` (Ground/Air)

Enables flight for a short while.

- **Repulsor Blast**: `D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Ironman channels energy from his hands. This attacks attracts enemies that get caught in it. 

- **Repulsor Spread**: `c` (while performing Repulsor Blast)

An energy explosion that repels enemies.

- **Unibeam**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

An energy beam from Ironman's chest.

- **Smart Bomb**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground/Air)

Ironman drops a pair of bombs. Can hit an opponent that's lying down and put them into a combo.

### 12p Super Moves

- **Proton Cannon**: `D, DF, F, a+b/b+c/a+c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Ironman calls on his trusted Proton Cannon and fires it horizontally. 
Both the cannon and the beam can hit the opponent.

- **Angled Proton Cannon**: `F, D, DF, a+b/b+c/a+c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Same as before, but fired diagonally. Again, both the cannon and the 
beam can hit the opponent.

- **Iron Avenger**: `D, DB, B, a+b/b+c/a+c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Ironman charges toward the opponent. If the move connects, they will be 
dragged and a powerful Unibeam will be fired at them. Has invicibility frames on startup. 
Qualifies as a throw. This move is not affected by damage scaling.
