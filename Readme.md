Robo (Beta) by SilentProtagonist 
--------------------------------

Release Date: December 11th, 2012.

Ayla is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is a beta version: in other words, it's not completely finished.

What's Missing:

- Small and big portraits
- More intros and/or winposes.


==============
Robo's Moveset
==============

Before starting, let me explain one thing about Robo. His second jump
works sort of like R.O.B.'s third jump in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (called
Robo Burner). Quoting SmashWiki: 

"Although it deals no damage, it can be used, then deactivated for an attack,
then reactivated (...) Robo Burner relies on fuel, which automatically
charges when R.O.B. is touching the ground, taking about 1.5 seconds
to fully charge."

Robo's propulsors do not require any special command to use: just hold down
Up, Left or Right while jumping and Robo will fly in that direction. You can
also fly up and forwards opr up and backwards.

In addition Robo's medium punch, hard punch and Air Rocket Punch require and use up
some of your fuel.

Specials
--------

*Robo Tackle
	Command: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing)
	Robo does a diagonal tackle into the air. The button used determines the

*Area Bomb
	Command: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)
	Robo stops and creates a small explosion around him.

*Rocket Punch
	Command: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing/Air)
	Robo sends his fist flying towards the opponent. The button used
	determines the fist's speed. The air version uses up some fuel and
	can't be used if you don't have enough.
