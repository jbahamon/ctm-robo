
Robo (Beta) by SilentProtagonist 
================================

Release Date: December 11th, 2012.

Ayla is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is a beta version: in other words, it's not completely finished.

What's Missing:

- Small and big portraits
- More intros and/or winposes.



Robo's Moveset
==============

Robo is a slow character. He hits hard but can't combo very well. 
His supers have a medium range, but it can be hard to combo into them if your 
opponent runs away.

That changes when he activates his thrusters.

His second jump works sort of like R.O.B.'s third jump in Super Smash Bros. 
Brawl (called Robo Burner). Quoting SmashWiki: 

"Although it deals no damage, it can be used, then deactivated for an attack,
then reactivated (...) Robo Burner relies on fuel, which automatically
charges when R.O.B. is touching the ground, taking about 1.5 seconds
to fully charge."

Robo's propulsors do not require any special command to use: just hold down
Up, Left or Right while jumping and Robo will fly in that direction. You can
also fly diagonally up.

In addition, Robo's medium punch, hard punch and Air Rocket Punch require and use up
some of your fuel. Robo's air attacks are faster and more comboable. 

This means Robo's fighting style switches between waiting for your fuel to recharge 
and rushing your opponent with air attacks. Keep your distance, find an opening and 
strike!


Throws
--------------

**Beast Toss**: F/B + [a+b/b+c/a+c] (Standing)

A standard throw. The direction you press determines the
direction your opponent will be thrown.

Specials
--------

**Robo Tackle**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing)

Robo does a diagonal tackle into the air. The button used determines the
attack's angle and damage.

**Area Bomb**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)

Robo stops and creates a small explosion around him. Use this as 
a combo finisher to create distance between you and your opponent.


**Rocket Punch**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing/Air)

Robo sends his fist flying towards the opponent. The button used
determines the fist's speed. The air version uses up some fuel and
can't be used if you don't have enough.


Supers
------

**Shock**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Similar to Area Bomb. Robo opens up and electrocutes anyone who comes too close.

**Uzzi Punch**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Robo throws a multi-punch in front of him. The attack ends with a small explosion. 
You can actually combo into this super move.

**Omega Laser**: ~D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Robo shoots a short-range laser towards the enemy.


Special Mode
------------

**Electrocute**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Robo overloads and an electric arc appears around him. The arc hits your opponent for very
small damage, but it allows you to perform better combos. You'll also get full fuel as long 
as Electrocute is active. Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, 
the mode ends. Go on the offensive!

Final Move
----------

**Prometheus Cannon**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing or Air, must have Berserker activated). Uses all of your Power.

Robo pulls a big cannon out of nowhere, and shoots a huge beam 
of energy. Note that you'll achieve maximum damage with this move if you 
shoot at point-blank. Even better if your opponent is against the end 
of the stage. To quote War Machine, "Here's my Sunday best!"
